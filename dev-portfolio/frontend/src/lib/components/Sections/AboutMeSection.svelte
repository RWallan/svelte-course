        Hey, I'm Richard, a Data Scientist with a background in Statistics and a
        passion for creating impactful, data-driven solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've had the opportunity to work with diverse datasets and tackle
        complex problems, developing my expertise in data manipulation,
        statistical modeling, and machine learning. Currently, I apply my skills
        at ScientifiCloud, where I dive into Python, R, and tools like
        LangChain, FastAPI, ScikitLearn, BigQuery and other databases to bring
        insights and innovative solutions to life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond coding, I value clear communication and collaboration. I thrive
        on making complex data accessible and actionable, crafting everything
        from insightful reports to dynamic dashboards with Svelte. With hands-on
        experience across sectors, I'm here to translate data into strategic,
        real-world insights that drive results.
